# Spikes

Timeboxed research or prototype tasks. Each spike should produce a **decision memo** and, if adopted, an **ADR** in `/docs/adr`.

Use this template:
```
# SPIKE-00X: <Question to answer>

Question: <What are we trying to learn or decide?>
Scope: <Small prototype or research scope>
Timebox: <e.g., 6 hours>
Acceptance: Decision memo with metrics vs baseline and a recommendation.
```
