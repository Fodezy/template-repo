# Project Workspace

Operational, living docs that evolve during delivery. Keep **templates** in `/templates`, long-term references in `/docs`. This folder holds your day-to-day plans.

## Contents

- `sprints/` — iteration plans and retros.
- `spikes/` — timeboxed investigations; promote outcomes to ADRs in `/docs/adr`.
- `risk-register.md` — running log of project risks.
- Links:
  - ADRs: `/docs/adr`
  - PRDs: `/docs/prd`
  - Diagrams: `/docs/diagrams`
  - UAT notes: `/docs/uat`
